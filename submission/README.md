# Mobina

Mobina is a Golang implementation of he DevX RUN SEAL JSON Transformer Coding Challenge. The program is able to transform arbitrary file types into a simplified (non recursive) JSON format.

## Local Execution Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MosesSupposes/mobina
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd submission
   ```
3. Run the project.
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
4. The program will prompt you to specify an input file to perform its transformation on. Example files have been provided and can be found in `submission/testData`. The easiest way to verify that the program meets all the project requirements is to enter `submission/testData/valid.json` into the standard when met with the prompt.
